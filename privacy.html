    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets spreadsheets (<code>.../auth/spreadsheets</code>):</strong> Required to create your nutrition tracker sheet and append food logs.</li>
            <li><strong>See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app (<code>.../auth/drive.file</code>):</strong> Required to ensure we can locate and manage the specific "MacroLens Tracker" file without accessing your other private files.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logging Food:</strong> We append rows to your Google Sheet containing the food items, calories, and macronutrients you ask us to track.</li>
            <li><strong>Retrieving History:</strong> We read the rows from your "MacroLens Tracker" sheet to display your recent eating history when you ask for a summary.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Analysis:</strong> Photos uploaded for analysis are processed by OpenAI's API to extract nutritional data. These photos are subject to OpenAI's data retention policies. We do not save your photos on our servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We do not use your Google Workspace data for training generalized AI models, serving advertisements, or surveillance.</strong></p>
